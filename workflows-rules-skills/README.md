# Workflows , Rules and Skills

* **Workflows**: Workflows enable you to define a series of steps to guide the Agent through a repetitive set of tasks, such as deploying a service or responding to PR comments.
* **Rules**: Rules are manually defined constraints for the Agent to follow, at both the local and global levels. Rules allow users to guide the agent to follow behaviors particular to their own use cases and style.
* **Skills**: An open standard for extending agent capabilities. A skill is a folder containing a `SKILL.md` file with instructions that the agent can follow when working on specific tasks.
