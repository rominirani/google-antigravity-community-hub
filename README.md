# 🌌 Google Antigravity Community Hub

Welcome to the **Google Antigravity Community Hub**. This repository is the central "Mission Control" for developers learning to build with the agentic-first development platform.

Here you will find a curated collection of codelabs, reusable skills, agent workflows, and community-driven resources to help you move from standard coding to orchestrating intelligent agents.

## 🚀 The Learning Path

If you are new to Antigravity, we recommend following this path sequentially to build your expertise.

### 1. Understand the Concept
**📖 Blog:** [Getting Started with Antigravity](https://bit.ly/49pBGld)  
*Learn the philosophy behind Agentic IDEs, "Mission Control," and the shift from autocomplete to autonomy.*

### 2. Experience the Agent
**💻 Codelab:** [Getting Started with Google Antigravity](https://bit.ly/4jHJGBr)  
*Get hands-on. Set up your environment, run your first agent, and learn how to review Implementation Plans.*

### 3. Build Real Applications
**🛠️ Codelab:** [Building with Google Antigravity](https://bit.ly/4pHICPy)  
*Move beyond "Hello World." Build full-stack applications and utilize the **Browsing** capability to have agents research the web.*

### 4. Master Advanced Skills
**🧠 Blog:** [Getting Started with Antigravity Skills](https://bit.ly/4b2dLJH)  
**🎓 Codelab:** [Getting Started with Skills in Google Antigravity](https://bit.ly/4aY9abx)  
*Deep dive into creating custom tools and reusable capabilities for your agents.*
