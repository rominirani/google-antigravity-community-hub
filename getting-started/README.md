## 🚀 The Learning Path

If you are new to Antigravity, we recommend following this path sequentially to build your expertise.

### 1. Understand the Concept
**📖 Blog:** [Getting Started with Antigravity](https://bit.ly/49pBGld)  
*Learn the philosophy behind Agentic IDEs, "Mission Control," and the shift from autocomplete to autonomy.*

### 2. Experience the Agent
**💻 Codelab:** [Getting Started with Google Antigravity](https://bit.ly/4jHJGBr)  
*Get hands-on. Set up your environment, run your first agent, and learn how to review Implementation Plans.*

### 3. Build Real Applications
**🛠️ Codelab:** [Building with Google Antigravity](https://bit.ly/4pHICPy)  
*Move beyond "Hello World." Build full-stack applications and utilize the **Browsing** capability to have agents research the web.*

### 4. Build and Deploy Google Cloud Serverless Apps
**🛠️ Codelab:** [Building with Google Antigravity](https://bit.ly/4avbbLv)  
*In this codelab, you will learn how to use Google Antigravity to design, build, and deploy a serverless application to Google Cloud. We will build a serverless and event-driven document pipeline that ingests files from Google Cloud Storage (GCS), processes them using Cloud Run and Gemini, and streams their metadata into BigQuery.*
