# Codelabs 

These are step-by-step tutorials and project files to accompany the official learning path.

A list of codelabs recommended by the community is given below: 

| Title (link) | Description | 
| :--- | :--- |
| **[Getting Started with Google Antigravity](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/getting-started-google-antigravity)** | In this codelab, you will learn about Google Antigravity, an agentic development platform, evolving the IDE into the agent-first era. This codelab covers installation/configuration and exploring key concepts of Antigravity like Agent Manager, Editor, Browser and more. |
| **[Building with Google Antigravity](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/building-with-google-antigravity#0)** | This codelab builds upon the Getting Started with Google Antigravity codelab and covers how to use Antigravity to build real applications. |
| **[Getting Started with Skills in Antigravity](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/getting-started-with-antigravity-skills)** | In this codelab, we will use Antigravity to build Agent Skills, a lightweight, open format for extending AI agent capabilities with specialized knowledge and workflows. You will be able to learn what Agent Skills are, their benefits and how they are constructed. You will then build multiple Agent Skills ranging from a Git formatter, template generator, tool code scaffolding and more, all usable within Antigravity. |
| **[Build and Deploy to Google Cloud with Antigravity](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/build-and-deploy-gcp-with-antigravity?hl=en#0)** | In this codelab, you will learn how to use Google Antigravity to design, build, and deploy a serverless application to Google Cloud. We will build a serverless and event-driven document pipeline that ingests files from Google Cloud Storage (GCS), processes them using Cloud Run and Gemini, and streams their metadata into BigQuery. |
